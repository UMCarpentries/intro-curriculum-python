## Pre-workshop setup steps

1. Install the following software (<a href="#install">all instructions are below</a>).
    - For online workshop: Zoom (make sure you have the latest version)
    - A Unix shell (e.g. bash, zsh)
    - [git](https://git-scm.com/)
    - [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download#Downloads) which is a Python distribution, package manager, and comes with popular tools such as JupyterLab.
1. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account if you do not already have one. You'll need to know the email associated with your account during the git lesson of the workshop.
1. After you have installed everything above, download [un-report.zip](https://github.com/UMCarpentries/intro-curriculum-python/raw/gh-pages/files/un-report.zip). You'll need the files included during the workshop.
    1. Move `un-report.zip` to your Desktop and unzip it (usually double-clicking it will work).
    1. Launch **JupyterLab** in a command line window (by typing `jupyter lab` and hit enter). 
    1. Once JupyterLab is opened in your web browser, in the left file browser, go to your `Desktop/`, `un-report/` folder and double-click the file `check_setup.ipynb` to open it in JupyterLab.
    1. In the toolbar at the top of the notebook, click the run button (â–¶). This will print out the versions of your Python and a few libraries that we will be using in this workshop.
    1. Take a screenshot of your JupyterLab window and send the screenshot to the lead instructor. If everything worked, they'll give you the workshop location (or Zoom meeting ID). Otherwise, they'll help you get everything setup correctly before giving you the information. 
    Please note since you are taking a screenshot of your browser window, make sure the screenshot do not contain any sensitive information that you do not wish to share.

If at any point you get stuck or run into problems, please don't hesitate to ask us for help!
