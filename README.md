This is the custom curriculum developed by the University of Michigan Software
Carpentry instance.
It is in the `beta` stage of development; we are continuing to host workshops to
gather feedback and polish the curriculum.

## Repo Layout

1. Top level files

    - `index.md` - The home page.
    - `reference.md` - Reference for learners.
    - `setup.md` - Setup instructions for learners.
    - `AUTHORS` - Plain text list of the lesson authors.
    - `CITATION` - Plain text citation instructions.

1. Lesson episodes

    - `_episodes/` - Source files in markdown. Episode order is determined by the filename.
    - `_episodes_rmd/` - Source files in R Markdown. A lesson should be written in one or the other markdown style, not both. To convert R Markdown files to markdown episodes, run `make lesson-rmd`.
    
    Run `make lesson-check` at any time
    to check that the lesson files follow the formatting rules

1. Figures are stored in `fig/`, data sets in `data/`, source code in `code/`, and miscellaneous files in `files/`.

1. `_extras/`

    - `about.md` - General notes about the curriculum.
    - `discussion.md` - For learners who would like to learn more.
    - `guide.md` - The instructor's guide for the curriculum.
    - `bonus_exercises.md` - Bonus exercises for learners who want to practice more.

## Rendering R Markdown episodes

To render all episodes in `_episodes_rmd/`, run:

```
make site
```

This will create markdown files in `_episodes/` for GitHub Pages.

To render just one episode, e.g. `_episodes_rmd/01-r-plotting.Rmd`, run:

```
make _episodes/01-r-plotting.md
```
