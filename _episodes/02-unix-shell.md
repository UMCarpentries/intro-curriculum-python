# Introducing the Shell
_[Back to top](#contents)_

## Motivation
_[Back to top](#contents)_

Usually you move around your computer and run programs through graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
For example, Finder for Mac and Explorer for Windows.
These GUIs are convenient because you can use your mouse to navigate to different folders and open different files.
However, there are some things you simply can’t do from these GUIs.

The Unix Shell (or the command line) allows you to do everything you would do through Finder/Explorer, and a lot more.
But it’s so scary! I thought so at first, too.
Since then, I’ve learned that it’s just another way to navigate your computer and run programs, and it can be super useful for your work.
For instance, you can use it to combine existing tools into a pipeline to automate analyses, you can write a script to do things for you and improve reproducibility, you can interact with remote machines and supercomputers that are far away from you, and sometimes it’s the only option for the program you want to run.

We’re going to use it to:
1. Organize our Python code and plots from the [Python plotting lesson]({{ page.root }}/01-python-plotting/).
1. Perform version control using git during the rest of the workshop.

## What the Shell looks like
_[Back to top](#contents)_

When you open up the terminal for the first time, it can look pretty scary - it’s basically just a blank screen.
Don’t worry - we’ll take you through how to use it step by step.

The first line of the shell shows a prompt - the shell is waiting for an input.
When you’re following along in the lesson, don’t type the prompt when typing commands.
To make the prompt the same for all of us, run this command:

```
PS1='$ '
```
{: .language-bash}

## Tree Structure
_[Back to top](#contents)_

The first thing we need to learn when using the shell is how to get around our computer.
The shell folder (directory) structure is the same file structure as you're used to.
We call the way that different directories are nested the "directory tree".
You start at the root directory (`/`) and you can move "up" and "down" the tree. Here's an example:

![Directory Tree]({{ page.root }}/fig/unix-shell/directory_tree_blank.png)

Now that we understand directory trees a bit, let's check it out from the command line.
We can see where we are by using the command `pwd` which stands for "print working directory", or the directory we are currently in:

```
pwd
```
{: .language-bash}

```
/home/USERNAME/
```
{: .output}

Congrats! You just ran your first command from the command line.
The output is a file path to a location (a directory) on your computer.

The output will look a little different depending on what operating system you're using:
- Mac: `/Users/USERNAME`
- Linux: `/home/USERNAME`
- Windows:  `/c/Users/USERNAME`

Let's check to see what's in your home directory using the `ls` command, which lists all of the files in your working directory:

```
ls
```
{: .language-bash}

```
Desktop     Downloads   Movies      Pictures
Documents   Library     Music       Public
```
{: .output}

You should see some files and directories you're familiar with such as `Documents` and `Desktop`.

If you make a typo, don't worry. If the shell can’t find a command you type, it will show you a helpful error message.

```
ks
```
{: .language-bash}

```
ks: command not found
```
{: .output}

This error message tells us the command we tried to run, `ks`, is not a command that is recognized, letting us know we might have made a mistake when typing.

## Man and Help
_[Back to top](#contents)_

Often we'll want to learn more about how to use a certain command such as `ls`. There are several different ways you can 
learn more about a specific command. 

Some commands have additional information that can be found by using the `-h` or `--help`
flags. This will print brief documentation for the command:

![]({{ page.root }}/fig/unix-shell/man_ls.png)

```
man -h
man --help
```
{: .language-bash}

![]({{ page.root }}/fig/unix-shell/man_help.png)

Other commands, such as `ls`, don't have help flags, but have manual pages with more information. We can navigate 
the manual page using the `man` command to view the description of a command and its options. For example, 
if you want to know more about the navigation options of `ls` you can type `man ls` on the command line:

```
man ls
```
{: .language-bash}

On the manual page for `ls`, we see a section titled **options**. These options, also called **flags**, are like arguments in Python functions, and allow us to customize how `ls` runs.

To get out of the man page, click `q`.

Sometimes, commands will have multiple flags that we want to use at the same time. For example, 
`ls` has a flag `-F` that displays a slash after all directories, as well as a flag `-a` that
includes hidden files and directories (ones that begin with a `.`). There are two ways to run 
`ls` using both of these flags:

```
ls -F -a
ls -Fa
```
{: .language-bash}

Note that when we run the `-a` command, we see a `.` and a `..` in the directory. The `.` corresponds to the current directory we are in and the `..` corresponds to the directory directly above us in the directory tree. We'll learn more about why this is useful in a bit.

> > 5. `ls -lS`
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

Next, let's move to our Desktop. To do this, we use `cd` to change directories.

Run the following command:

```
cd Desktop
```
{: .language-bash}

Let's see if we're in the right place:

```
pwd
```
{: .language-bash}

```
/home/USERNAME/Desktop
```
{: .output}

We just moved _down_ the directory tree into the `Desktop` directory.

What files and directories do you have on your Desktop? How can you check?
```
ls
```
{: .language-bash}

```
list.txt
un-report
notes.pdf
Untitled.png
```
{: .output}

Your Desktop will likely look different, but the important thing is that you see the folder we worked in for the Python plotting lesson.
Is the `un-report` directory listed on your Desktop?

How can we get into the `un-report` directory?

```
cd un-report
```
{: .language-bash}

We just went _down_ the directory tree again.

Let's see what files are in `un-report`:
```
ls
```
{: .language-bash}

```
awesome_plot.jpg
awesome_violin_plot.jpg
gapminder_1997.csv
gapminder_data.csv
gdp_population.ipynb
```
{: .output}

Is it what you expect? Are the files you made in the Python plotting lesson there?

Now let's move back _up_ the directory tree. First, let's try this command:

```
cd Desktop
```
{: .language-bash}

```
cd: Desktop: No such file or directory
```
{: .output}

This doesn't work because the `Desktop` directory is not within the directory that we are currently in.

To move up the directory tree, you can use `..`, which is the parent of the current directory:
```
cd ..
pwd
```
{: .language-bash}

```
/home/USERNAME/Desktop
```
{: .output}

Everything that we've been doing is working with file paths. We tell the computer where we want to go using `cd` plus the file path. We can also tell the computer what files we want to list by giving a file path to `ls`:

```
ls un-report
```
{: .language-bash}

```
awesome_plot.jpg
awesome_violin_plot.jpg
gapminder_1997.csv
gapminder_data.csv
gdp_population.ipynb
```
{: .output}


```
ls ..
```
{: .language-bash}

```
list.txt
un-report
notes.pdf
Untitled.png
```
{: .output}

What happens if you just type `cd` without a file path?

```
cd
pwd
```
{: .language-bash}

```
/home/USERNAME
```
{: .output}

It takes you back to your home directory!

To get back to your projects directory you can use the following command:

```
cd Desktop/un-report
```
{: .language-bash}

We have been using _relative paths_, meaning you use your current working directory to get to where you want to go.

You can also use the _absolute path_, or the entire path from the root directory. What's listed when you use the `pwd` command is the absolute path:

```
pwd
```
{: .language-bash}

You can also use `~` for the path to your home directory:

```
cd ~
pwd
```
{: .language-bash}

```
/home/USERNAME
```
{: .output}

# Working with files and directories
_[Back to top](#contents)_

Now that we know how to move around your computer using the command line, our next step is to organize the project that we started in the [Python plotting lesson]({{ page.root }}/01-python-plotting/)
You might ask: why would I use the command line when I could just use the GUI?
My best response is that if you ever need to use a high-performance computing cluster (such as Great Lakes at the University of Michigan), you’ll have no other option.
You might also come to like it more than clicking around to get places once you get comfortable, because it’s a lot faster!

First, let’s make sure we’re in the right directory (the `un-reports` directory):

```
pwd
```
{: .language-bash}

```
/home/USERNAME/Desktop/un-reports
```
{: .output}

If you’re not there, `cd` to the correct place.

Next, let’s remind ourselves what files are in this directory:

```
ls
```
{: .language-bash}
```
awesome_plot.jpg
awesome_violin_plot.jpg
gapminder_1997.csv
gapminder_data.csv
gdp_population.ipynb
```
{: .output}

TODO: update listing output

You can see that right now all of our files are in our main directory.
However, it can start to get crazy if you have too many different files of different types all in one place!
We’re going to create a better project directory structure that will help us organize our files. This is really important, particularly for larger projects.
If you’re interested in learning more about structuring computational biology projects in particular, [here](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424) is a useful article.

What do you think good would be a good way to organize our files?

One way is the following:
```
.
├── code
│   └── gdp_population.ipynb
├── data
│   ├── gapminder_1997.csv
    └── gapminder_data.csv
└── figures
    ├── awesome_plot.jpg
    └── awesome_violin_plot.jpg
```
{: .language-bash}

The IPython notebook goes in the code directory, the gapminder datasets go in the data directory, and the figures go in the figures directory.
This way, all of the files are organized into a clearer overall structure.

A few notes about naming files and directories:
- Don’t use whitespaces because they’re used to break arguments on the command line, so it makes things like moving and viewing files more complicated.
Instead you can use a dash (`-`) or an underscore (`_`).
- Don’t start names with a dash (`-`) because the shell will interpret it incorrectly.
- Stick with letters, numbers, periods, dashes, and underscores, because other symbols (e.g. `^`, `&`) have special meanings.
- If you have to refer to names of files or directories with whitespace or other special characters, use double quotes. For example, if you wanted to change into a directory called `My Code`, you will want to type `cd "My Code"`, not `cd My Code`.

So how do we make our directory structure look like this?

First, we need to make a new directory. Let’s start with the `code` directory. To do this, we use the command `mkdir` plus the name of the directory we want to make:

```
mkdir code
```
{: .language-bash}


Now, let’s see if that directory exists now:

```
ls
```
{: .language-bash}
```
awesome_plot.jpg
awesome_violin_plot.jpg
code
gapminder_1997.csv
gapminder_data.csv
```
{: .output}


How can we check to see if there’s anything in the `code` directory?

```
ls code
```
{: .language-bash}
```

```
{: .output}

Nothing in there yet, which is expected since we just made the directory.

The next step is to move the `.ipynb` file into the code directory. To do this, we use the `mv` command. The first argument after `mv` is the file you want to move, and the second argument is the place you want to move it:

```
mv gdp_population.ipynb code
```
{: .language-bash}

Okay, let’s see what’s in our current directory now:

```
ls
```
{: .language-bash}
```
awesome_plot.jpg
awesome_violin_plot.jpg
code
gapminder_1997.csv
gapminder_data.csv
```
{: .output}

`gdp_population.ipynb` is no longer there! Where did it go? Let’s check the code directory, where we moved it to:

```
ls code
```
{: .language-bash}
```
gdp_population.ipynb
```
{: .output}

There it is!

> ## Creating directories and moving files
>
> Create a `data` directory and move `gapminder_data.csv` and `gapminder_1997.csv` into the newly created `data` directory.
> > ## Solution

> >  ```
> > mkdir data
> > mv gapminder_data.csv data
> > mv gapminder_1997.csv data
> > ```
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

Okay, now we have the code and data in the right place. But we have several figures that should still be in their own directory.

First, let’s make a `figures` directory:

```
mkdir figures
```
{: .language-bash}

Next, we have to move the figures. But we have so many figures! It’d be annoying to move them one at a time. Thankfully, we can use a _wildcard_ to move them all at once. Wildcards are used to match files and directories to patterns.

One example of a wildcard is the asterisk, `*`. This special character is interpreted as "multiple characters of any kind".

Let’s see how we can use a wildcard to list only files with the extension `.jpg`:

```
ls *jpg
```
{: .language-bash}
```
awesome_plot.jpg
awesome_violin_plot.jpg
```
{: .output}

See how only the files ending in `.jpg` were listed? The shell expands the wildcard to create a list of matching file names before running the commands. Can you guess how we move all of these files at once to the figures directory?

```
mv *jpg figures
```
{: .language-bash}

We can also use the wildcard to list all of the files in all of the directories:

```
ls *
```
{: .language-bash}
```
code:
gdp_population.ipynb

data:
gapminder_1997.csv  gapminder_data.csv

figures:
awesome_plot.jpg    awesome_violin_plot.jpg
```
{: .output}

This output shows each directory name, followed by its contents on the next line. As you can see, all of the files are now in the right place!

> > 4. None. None of the files end in only `ane`. This would have listed files if `ls *ane*` were used instead.

> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

## Viewing Files
_[Back to top](#contents)_

To view and navigate the contents of a file we can use the command `less`. This will open a full screen view of the file.

For instance, we can run the command `less` on our `gapminder_data.csv` file:

```
less data/gapminder_data.csv
```

![]({{ page.root }}/fig/unix-shell/less_example.png)

To navigate, press `spacebar` to scroll to the next page and `b` to scroll up to the previous page. You can also use the up and down arrows to scroll line-by-line. Note that `less` defaults to line wrapping, meaning that any lines longer than the width of the screen will be wrapped to the next line. To exit less, press the letter `q`.

One particularly useful flag for `less` is `-S` which cuts off really long lines (rather than having the text wrap around):

```
less -S data/gapminder_data.csv
```

To navigate, press `spacebar` to scroll to the next page and `b` to scroll up to the previous page. You can also use the up and down arrows to scroll line-by-line. Note that `less` defaults to line wrapping, meaning that any lines longer than the width of the screen will be wrapped to the next line, (to disable this use the option `-S` when running `less`, ex `less -S file.txt`). To exit less, press the letter `q`.

Note that not all file types can be viewed with `less`. While we can open PDFs and excel spreadsheets easily with programs on our computer, `less` doesn't render them well on the command line. For example, if we try to less a .pdf file we will see a warning.

```
less figures/awesome_plot.jpg
```

```
figures/awesome_plot.jpg may be a binary file.  See it anyway?
```
{: .output}

If we say "yes", less will render the file but it will appear as a seemingly random display of characters that won't make much sense to us.

# Glossary of terms
_[Back to top](#contents)_

- root: the very top of the file system tree
- absolute path: the location of a specific file or directory starting from the root of the file system tree

- `pwd`: Print working directory - prints the _absolute path_ from the _root_ directory to the directory where you currently are.
- `ls`: List files - lists files in the current directory. You can provide a path to list files to another directory as well (`ls [path]`).
- `cd [path]`: Change directories - move to another folder.
- `mkdir`: Make directory - creates a new directory
- `..`: This will move you up one level in the file system tree

- `less`: - quick way to view a document without using a full text editor
- `man`: Manual - allows you to view the bash manual for another command (e.g. `man ls`)
- `-h/--help`: Help - argument that pulls up the help manual for a program
- `nano`: a user-friendly text editor
- `*`: Wildcard - matches zero of more characters in a filename
